# [How to Watch.!] Villanova vs UConn:Live Stream Men’s College Basketball Live, TV Channel

The UConn Huskies are back home on Tuesday night when they take on the Villanova Wildcats in college basketball. The Huskies come in Tuesday night looking to bounce back from a shocking overtime loss to Seton Hall. It was the worst loss of the season for the Huskies and dropped them to 17-8 overall and 9-5 in the Big East. They have gone just 5-5 over their last 10 games, but all five of those losses have come by six points or less. 

One of them was back at the beginning of January against the Wildcats. They trailed by as many as 11 in the second half and despite tying the game up on a couple of occasions, they couldn’t get over the hump. The Huskies have been led by Liam McNeeley, who is scoring a team-best 15.1 points per game. Solo Ball and Alex Karaban have also been good, as they are scoring 14.8 and 14.5 points per game respectively.
